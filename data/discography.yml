        Burning Fire is a nostalgic anthem that encapsulates the road-tripping adventures through Australia that marked the beginning of Captain Courageous.

        The song was born from a serendipitous moment when a friend strummed a guitar and sang the word 'Refraction' during a conversation, sparking the creative connection that would shape our music.

        Inspired by sun-soaked landscapes, endless highways, and the bittersweet beauty of fleeting moments, Burning Fire blends driving guitar riffs and uplifting melodies to evoke the thrill of open roads, while its lyrics paint vivid snapshots of carefree days and deep connections.
      shortDescription: "A nostalgic, road-trip anthem born from a serendipitous guitar-and-lyric spark. Big riffs, bright hooks, feel-good energy."

            Roll in at dawn from drinking and smoking
            6am that's when we start talking
            Our burning fire
            We were dancing on the flames
            Setting sail for new horizons
            Eating up the miles in a Nissan Skyline
            All along the highways
            And rolling on the waves

            Feel the joy of Refraction
            This was our kind of action
            No need for your reaction
            In this moment let's just be
            Card games and wine in a box
            Heading north, joining the dots
            Happy just getting lost
            Watching the light bend through the sea

            The rough guide our gospel
            Some crazy guy at the hostel
            He took too much up his nostril
            Rolling sideways he hit the floor
            Westpac surveys in Manly
            About how happy you can be
            Arana Hills isn't fancy
            Hit my head on the late night bus
            But no fuss

            Roll in at dawn from drinking and smoking
            6am that's when we start talking
            Our burning fire
            We were dancing on the flames
            Setting sail for new horizons
            Eating up the miles in a Nissan Skyline
            All along the highways
            And rolling on the waves

            There's no jobs at the Wizard
            And Thredbo needed a blizzard
            The mountain roads made us dizzy
            Singing along to Brandon's Bones
            Let's get a haircut in Brisbane
            Meet some girls, surrender our wisdom
            Bending light through a prism
            A souvenir to take back home
            And all alone

            Roll in at dawn from drinking and smoking
            6am that's when we start talking
            Our burning fire
            We were dancing on the flames
            Setting sail for new horizons
            Eating up the miles in a Nissan Skyline
            All along the highways
            And rolling on the waves

        Astronomic was written during the stillness of the 2020 lockdown, inspired by a friend's casual comment about stargazing.

        The song captures a sense of wonder, introspection, and longing - a moment of looking to the skies when the world felt so small yet so vast. It quickly became a favorite in Lewis' virtual open mic nights on Facebook, resonating with listeners during a time when connection felt more important than ever.

        The original recording was crafted remotely over several sessions in 2020, blending our ideas and energies from afar.

        After sitting on ice while life pulled us in different directions, Astronomic has finally found its place, polished and ready to shine - just like the stars that inspired it.

          lyrics: |
            When the world shuts itself away
            Our ties begin to separate
            Looking to the skies and see those lights sinking into your eyes
            Your beauty has me on the hook
            I wanna take a closer look
            Searching through the night, inspired, pinning my hopes on a satellite

            You've got me feeling astronomic
            My mind is racing like a comet
            Oh, draw me into your tapestry
            For dreaming has no boundary
            You've got me feeling astronomic
            My head is spinning and I want it
            Oh, lose myself in your majesty
            For dreaming has no boundary
            Woah-oh

            Each night the sky so clear
            All I want is to be here
            The rings of Jupiter
            The red of Mars
            Venus close enough to sparkle
            So far away and yet so near
            How long have you been up here
            An empty head has space to dream
            Imagining the possibilities

            You've got me feeling astronomic
            My mind is racing like a comet
            Oh, draw me into your tapestry
            For dreaming has no boundary
            You've got me feeling astronomic
            My head is spinning and I want it
            Oh, lose myself in your majesty
            For dreaming has no boundary

            Woah-oh
            Woah-oh-oh
            Woah-oh-oh
            Woah-oh-oh
            Oh

            You've got me feeling astronomic
            My mind is racing like a comet
            Oh, Draw me into your tapestry
            For dreaming has no boundary
            You've got me feeling astronomic
            My head is spinning and I want it
            Oh, lose myself in your majesty
            For dreaming has no boundary
            Woah-oh
