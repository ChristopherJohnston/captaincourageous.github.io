We care about your privacy. This page explains what data we collect and how we use it.

## Cookies and Analytics

- We use Google Analytics to understand how people use our site.
- Analytics cookies are non-essential. We only enable them if you **accept** cookies via the banner.
- If you **reject**, we will not send analytics events.

## What We Track

We track basic engagement to improve the site:

- Streaming link clicks (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music)
- Social media link clicks
- Merch store link clicks
- Email contact clicks
- Press kit downloads

These are recorded as anonymous, aggregated events. We do not collect personal data through these events.

## Cross-domain

Our merch store is hosted on Square. We use the same Google Analytics property across our website and the Square store to measure overall engagement. You can opt out at any time via your browser settings.

## Managing Consent

- You can accept or reject analytics cookies via the banner.
- Your choice is stored in your browser (local storage).
- To change your choice, clear site data in your browser and refresh the page.
